Javascript:- Js is a client-side and server-side language that allow you to make web pages interactive.
it makes your website dynamic.
Note:- Javacsript is a typeless(loosly typed) language which makes Javacsript to be dynamic. 
    /* var x = "anshika";
        x= 10;
    */

    ==>By using js we can create some games, web/mobile app , real-time networking apps, command-line tools.
    ==>Javacsript is executed by browser.

variable in Javascript:- var , const, let

Rules of creating a variable:-
    1. variables are case senstive
    2. variable name cannot start with numbers
    3. It should be started from _ , character. (var _fname , fname) // allowed
    4. only underscore is used as a special character. 
    5. spaces are not allowed between variable names. (var f name= "name") // not allowed
    6. you cannot use variable name as keyword. (var for = "abc")// not allowed

Two types of datatype: 1. Primitive , 2. Reference 
    1. Primitive:
        a. string ---- var x="anshika"; var y='anshi';
        b. boolean ---- var t= true ; var f = false;
        c. number ----- var distance= 40;  var cal= 40.7;
        d. Undefined ------ var x ;
        e. null ---- var typeOfTraining= null; //typeof typeOfTraining => object

    2. Reference (Non Primitive Datatype): 
        a. object
        b. array
        c. function

Note:---- we can check the datatype of a variable by using "typeof" keyword.


Javascript works in two mode: 1. sloppy mode 2. strict mode
    1. sloppy mode:--  It is a by default mode
        lastday="Sunday";
        console.log(lastday); 

    2. strict mode:--
        "use strict";
         lastday="Sunday"; // not allowed
         console.log(lastday); //Uncaught ReferenceError: lastday is not defined
         var lastday="Sunday"; // allowed
         console.log(lastday);


Dialog Boxes:
    1. alert:-- use to display some message as a notification
    2. prompt:-- use to take inputs from user
    3. confirm:-- which takes inputs as "yes" or "no"

Type conversion:
    1. implicit
    2. explicit
