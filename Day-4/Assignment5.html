                <p class="para">Over the last 8 years we have mastered the art and the process of building fixed odd
                    betting games
                    for the global gaming industry (Online and Landbased). We work with industry leading Mathematicians.
                    We have a strong Art team, Build Engines/Services for most gaming platforms in the Industry, Have a
                    well-established framework for building games (Quest), cover all online regulations and a large no.
                    of Landbased regulations and physically test games on our large library of devices in-house.

                    We support some of our customers with all the above, meaning we help them build bespoke/life time
                    exclusive games and for some we simply help them with any of the elements of the games (Art, math,
                    Engines, Services, Game Clients, QA & Compliance). In addition we have also expanded our services to
                    working more closely on Platform Development, Maintenance, Dev Ops, RGS integrations and QA Services
                    (For both Online and Landbased businesses).

                    We donâ€™t build games for ourselves (To eliminate any possible conflict of interest with our
                    customers) and there is no revenue share for any of our services. This has allowed us the
                    opportunity to work with many of the gaming industry's leading companies (Operators, Software
                    Suppliers and Content Businesses).</p>

                    <h4>Introduction to Python</h4>
                    <p class="p">Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design
                        philosophy
                        emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentationPython is dynamically-typed
                        and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
                        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                        library.Python can be used to perform complex mathematics problems.

                    <h4>Introduction to c++</h4>
                    <p class="p">C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in
                        1979 at
                        Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions
                        of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of
                        C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a
                        chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management,
                        better performance and finally a robust software development..</p>

                    <h4>Introduction to Javascript</h4>
                    <p class="p">JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of
                        the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of
                        websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating
                        third-party libraries.All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
                        the code on users' devices.

                        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation</p>

                    <h4>Introduction to Java</h4>
                    <p class="p">Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.
                        Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides
                        support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
                        The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code
                        runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
                        Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities
                        like pointers.</p>
